    <a href="https://zachdimond.com/airbnb-experiences-clone/">"AirBnB Experiences" clone in React</a><br>
    <p>This was a practice at using <code>.map()</code> and props in React, as well as continued practice with CSS styling. The 2nd major project from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8">React Tutorial on Youtube</a> taught by Bob Ziroll of <a href="https://scrimba.com">Scrimba</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This project was really meant to be viewed on mobile, but I made it so that desktop versions allow you to view it as mobile-like.</li>
        <li>The biggest challenge here, for me, was learning about importing images: where — and especially WHY — we do that. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfloyd" target="_blank">Graham Floyd</a> for 'splainin it all to me.</li>
        <li>I also got to experience using structured data for the first time — for the props, I needed to have a separate <code>data.js</code> file that would allow me to dynamically insert multiple properties into a reusable React component. Fun!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a first go at React, and I built it after a few hours of lessons from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8">React Tutorial on Youtube</a> taught by Bob Ziroll of <a href="https://scrimba.com">Scrimba</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Currently, it looks a little rough on mobile.</li>
        <li>Most of the dimensions were hardcoded in <code>px</code> based off of a figma diagram, so I will probably amend that once I spend a little more time with it.</li>
        <li>I am struggling with getting Fontawesome to work with React, so the icons are just images.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This was coded in vanilla JS, and built almost entirely from scratch. It's not perfect, but dang, it felt good!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I was able to get it to adjust based on screen size.</li>
        <li>I came up with the idea for the running sprite, which was fun. That part doesn't work perfectly on every screen, but it's close.</li>
